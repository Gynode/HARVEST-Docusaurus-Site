## Getting Started

Welcome to the HARVEST blockchain! This guide will help you get started with using the HARVEST network, a high-performance blockchain designed for enterprise applications. HARVEST uses a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which means that it is a permissioned network with a set of known and trusted validators.

### What is HARVEST Blockchain?

HARVEST is a blockchain platform that is optimized for security, scalability, and performance. It is an ideal platform for building a wide range of applications, including:

-   **Supply Chain Management**: Track the movement of goods and assets with a high degree of transparency and trust.
-   **Financial Services**: Build new financial products and services that are more efficient and accessible than traditional systems.
-   **Digital Identity**: Create and manage self-sovereign digital identities.

### System Requirements

To interact with the HARVEST blockchain, you will need:

-   A modern web browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
-   An internet connection.
-   A HARVEST-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask.

### Setting up MetaMask for HARVEST

MetaMask is a popular browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum-compatible blockchains like HARVEST. To set up MetaMask for HARVEST, you will need to add the HARVEST network as a custom RPC network.

1.  Install the MetaMask browser extension.
2.  Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown at the top.
3.  Select "Custom RPC".
4.  Enter the following information:
    -   **Network Name**: HARVEST
    -   **New RPC URL**: https://rpc.harvest.network
    -   **Chain ID**: 4224
    -   **Currency Symbol**: HRV
    -   **Block Explorer URL**: https://explorer.harvest.network
5.  Click "Save".

You are now connected to the HARVEST network and can start interacting with dApps and managing your HRV tokens.

## HARVEST Wallet Guide

Your HARVEST wallet is your gateway to the HARVEST ecosystem. It allows you to store and manage your HRV tokens, interact with smart contracts and dApps, and participate in the governance of the network.

### Creating a Wallet

If you are new to the world of blockchain, the easiest way to get started is by creating a wallet with MetaMask. Once you have installed the MetaMask browser extension, you can create a new wallet by following the on-screen instructions. **It is very important to write down your 12-word seed phrase and store it in a safe and secure location.** Your seed phrase is the only way to recover your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your computer.

### Your HARVEST Address

Your HARVEST address is a unique identifier that you can use to send and receive HRV tokens. It is a long string of letters and numbers that starts with "0x". You can find your HARVEST address at the top of the MetaMask window.

### Securing Your Wallet

-   **Never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone.**
-   **Be wary of phishing scams.** Never enter your seed phrase or private key on a website that you do not trust.
-   **Use a strong password for your MetaMask wallet.**
-   **Consider using a hardware wallet for added security.** Hardware wallets are physical devices that store your private keys offline, making them much more difficult to compromise.

## HRV Token Management

HRV is the native token of the HARVEST blockchain. It is used to pay for transaction fees and to interact with smart contracts and dApps.

### Sending and Receiving HRV

You can send and receive HRV tokens using your MetaMask wallet. To send HRV, you will need the recipient's HARVEST address. To receive HRV, you will need to provide your HARVEST address to the sender.

### Transaction Fees

Every transaction on the HARVEST blockchain requires a small fee, which is paid in HRV. The fee is used to reward the authority nodes for validating transactions and securing the network. The transaction fee is typically very low, but it can vary depending on the complexity of the transaction.

## Using Smart Contracts and dApps

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Decentralized applications (dApps) are applications that are built on top of a blockchain network and use smart contracts to power their logic.

### Interacting with dApps

You can interact with dApps on the HARVEST network using your MetaMask wallet. When you visit a dApp website, you will be prompted to connect your wallet. Once you have connected your wallet, you can start using the dApp.

### Approving Transactions

When you interact with a dApp, you may be asked to approve transactions. For example, if you want to buy an NFT on a marketplace dApp, you will need to approve a transaction to transfer the HRV tokens from your wallet to the seller a

## Asset Tracking with NFTs

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that can be used to represent ownership of a wide variety of items, both digital and physical. On the HARVEST blockchain, NFTs can be used to track the provenance and ownership of assets in a supply chain.

### How it Works

1.  **An NFT is created for each asset.** The NFT contains information about the asset, such as its origin, its current owner, and its transaction history.
2.  **The NFT is updated at each step of the supply chain.** As the asset moves through the supply chain, the NFT is updated to reflect its new location and owner.
3.  **The NFT can be viewed by anyone.** The NFT can be viewed on a block explorer, which provides a transparent and auditable record of the asset s journey.

### Benefits of Using NFTs for Asset Tracking

-   **Increased Transparency**: NFTs provide a transparent and auditable record of the asset s journey, which can help to reduce fraud and improve efficiency.
-   **Enhanced Security**: NFTs are stored on the blockchain, which makes them very difficult to tamper with or counterfeit.
-   **Improved Efficiency**: NFTs can help to automate many of the manual processes involved in asset tracking, which can save time and money.

## Security Best Practices

-   **Keep your software up to date.** Make sure you are using the latest version of your web browser and the MetaMask extension.
-   **Be careful what you click on.** Be wary of phishing scams and other malicious websites.
-   **Use a different password for every website.** This will help to protect you if one of your accounts is compromised.
-   **Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.** Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.

## Troubleshooting

-   **I can t connect to the HARVEST network.** Make sure you have entered the correct RPC URL and Chain ID in MetaMask.
-   **My transaction is pending.** Transactions can sometimes take a few minutes to be confirmed. If your transaction has been pending for a long time, you can try increasing the gas price.

## Frequently Asked Questions

-   **What is the difference between HARVEST and Ethereum?** HARVEST is a permissioned blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism, while Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. This makes HARVEST more scalable and efficient than Ethereum, but it also means that it is not as decentralized.
-   **How can I get HRV tokens?** You can get HRV tokens by participating in the HARVEST ecosystem or by purchasing them on a cryptocurrency exchange.
