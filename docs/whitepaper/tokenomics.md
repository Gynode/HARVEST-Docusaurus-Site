# Tokenomics

* **Native Asset:** HARVEST Coin is described as a Cardano-native asset.
* **Utility:** Primarily accepted for course payments at the HARVEST Online College (paid in selected cryptocurrencies including HARVEST coin), creating direct utility and demand for a Cardano-native asset.
* **Supply:** 1 Billion HARVEST tokens have already been minted on Cardano. This demonstrates significant prior commitment and provides a ready asset for the HARVEST sidechain and its utility.
* **Future Utility:** Revenue from online college courses (paid in selected cryptocurrencies including HARVEST coin) and farm operations will contribute to the DAO treasury, funding future development and community initiatives.
