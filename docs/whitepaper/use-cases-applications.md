# Use Cases & Applications

* **RWA Tokenization:** Ethical and decentralized financial models for tangible assets via the farm pilot, acquired through a Sharia-compliant Mudarabah contract. Future plans for fractionalized RWA ownership/profit-sharing for broader community participation.
* **Education & Verifiable Credentials:** An online learning platform specifically designed for AI and Blockchain courses. It will issue NFT-based verifiable academic certificates on the HARVEST sidechain. While initially launching with 3 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced courses each for AI and Blockchain as well as a diploma in Computer Science majoring in AI & Blockchain, the college is poised to add new specialized courses as resources allow.
* **Community Governance:** Facilitated through the HARVEST sidechain. Community-Driven Governance (HARVEST DAO) will transition through a clear, phased roadmap for progressive decentralization, controlled by its token holders.
* **Payments:** HARVEST Coin as the primary payment method for online college courses (paid in selected cryptocurrencies including HARVEST coin).
