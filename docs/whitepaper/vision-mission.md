title: Vision & Mission
---

HARVEST's mission is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI & blockchain technology and tangible real-world impact. Its vision is to build an ethical Cardano sidechain ecosystem.

HARVEST envisions a self-sustaining ecosystem where:
* The HARVEST DAO progressively takes full control of the sidechain, RWA initiatives, the online college and any further projects launched by the HARVEST project.
* Revenue from online college courses (paid in selected cryptocurrencies including HARVEST coin) and farm operations contributes to the DAO treasury, funding future development and community initiatives.
* The RWA farm becomes a template for future ethical, tokenized real-world assets on the HARVEST sidechain, unlocking new economic opportunities.
* The online college aims to become a leading global hub specializing in accessible, blockchain-verified AI and Blockchain education. While initially launching with 3 Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced courses each for AI and Blockchain and a diploma in Computer Science majoring in AI & Blockchain, the college is designed to continually expand its course offerings as resources allow.
* The apprenticeship program continues to feed skilled talent into the HARVEST ecosystem and the broader Cardano community.

The project is committed to open-source development and active engagement with the Cardano community to ensure HARVEST truly contributes to a decentralized, impactful and ethically sound future. The unique blend of RWA, ethical finance, education and skill development and its success in the Western Cape can inspire and inform similar initiatives anywhere else. In essence this "local" project is being launched as a "global learning laboratory" and a "scalable template" for the Cardano ecosystem.
