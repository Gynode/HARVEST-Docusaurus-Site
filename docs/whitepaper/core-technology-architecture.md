*  **HARVEST Sidechain Development:** A specialized sidechain built on Cardano. 
    *  **Purpose:** To facilitate efficient, low-cost and scalable transactions for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, educational verifiable credentials and community governance. 
    *  **Planned Features:** Finalization of HARVEST sidechain technical architecture (consensus, interoperability with Cardano mainnet).   Detailed design of the two-way peg/bridge mechanism for HARVEST token.   Initial smart contract development for on-chain Mudarabah terms.   Deployment to testnet (Month 6-8).   Transition to mainnet (Month 9-12, contingent on successful testing and audits). 
*  **Real-World Asset (RWA) Integration - The HARVEST Farm Pilot:** 
    *  **Initial RWA:** A groundbreaking partnership with the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) to establish an agro-eco-tourism farm outside Cape Town, serving as HARVEST's inaugural RWA. [cite: 44]  This farm will also host an IT laboratory for AI and Blockchain R&D. 
    *  **Financial Model:** This farm is acquired via a Sharia-compliant Mudarabah contract, demonstrating an ethical and decentralized financial model for tangible assets. 
    *  **Integration:** Pilot integration of initial farm data (e.g., clean energy production, visitor metrics) via oracles to HARVEST sidechain. 
    *  **Future:** Develop future plans for fractionalized RWA ownership/profit-sharing for broader community participation. 
*  **Verifiable Credentials:** 
    *  NFT-based verifiable academic certificates will be issued on the HARVEST sidechain by the HARVEST Online College.
