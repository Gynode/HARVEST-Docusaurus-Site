---

* **Month 1-2: Sidechain Blueprint & RWA Integration Planning**
    * Finalize HARVEST sidechain technical architecture (consensus, interoperability with Cardano mainnet).
    * Detailed design of the two-way peg/bridge mechanism for HARVEST token.
    * Legal consultation and framework development for RWA tokenization (focus on South African regulatory landscape for Mudarabah and asset tokenization).
    * Initial smart contract development for on-chain Mudarabah terms (transparent profit sharing).
    * Recruit and onboard 5 apprentices.
    * **Deliverables:** Technical specification document for HARVEST sidechain, legal report on RWA tokenization pathway, apprenticeship onboarding reports.
* **Month 3-5: Online College & Apprenticeship Acceleration**
    * Development of HARVEST Online College LMS platform (UI/UX, backend infrastructure).
    * Integration of payment gateway (including crypto) into the college LMS.
    * Development of smart contracts for NFT-based verifiable academic certificates on HARVEST sidechain.
    * Coding apprentices actively contribute to LMS and smart contract development.
    * Communications apprentice develops college marketing strategy and initial social media campaigns.
    * Woodworking apprenticeships commence.
    * **Deliverables:** Functional college LMS prototype with HARVEST payment integration, smart contracts for NFT certificates deployed to testnet, apprenticeship progress reports.
* **Month 6-8: RWA Farm Integration & Initial Operations**
    * Deployment of HARVEST sidechain to testnet.
    * Pilot integration of initial farm data (e.g., clean energy production, visitor metrics) via oracles to HARVEST sidechain.
    * Launch of "Beginner Blockchain" and "2-hour Corporate User" courses on the online college, accepting HARVEST coin.
    * Formal training for apprentices continues with increasing practical contributions.
    * Initial eco-tourism and small-scale farming operations commence at the farm, providing real-world data streams.
    * **Deliverables:** HARVEST sidechain live on testnet, 2 online college courses publicly accessible, initial farm RWA data streams integrated, detailed apprenticeship work logs and progress reviews.
* **Month 9-12: Decentralization & Scaling**
    * Transition HARVEST sidechain to mainnet (contingent on successful testing and audits).
    * Launch of Intermediate and Advanced AI/Blockchain courses.
    * Implement initial DAO governance framework on HARVEST sidechain, outlining path to decentralization of MJC control.
    * Develop future plans for fractionalized RWA ownership/profit-sharing for broader community participation.
    * Community outreach and growth for both college enrollment and HARVEST DAO participation.
    * **Deliverables:** HARVEST sidechain mainnet deployment, full course catalog available, HARVEST DAO governance framework published, community growth metrics, post-project audit/report.
