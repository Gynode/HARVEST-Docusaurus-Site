## Installation Procedures

Installing a HARVEST node involves setting up the software, configuring the network, and initializing the blockchain. The following instructions cover both automated and manual installation methods.

### Automated Installation with Docker

For most use cases, Docker provides the simplest and most reliable way to deploy a HARVEST node.

```bash
# Pull the official HARVEST PoA Docker image
docker pull harvest/harvest-poa:latest

# Create a data directory on the host
mkdir -p /var/lib/harvest

# Run the HARVEST node container
docker run -d --name harvest-node \
  -v /var/lib/harvest:/root/.harvest \
  -p 30303:30303 -p 8545:8545 \
  harvest/harvest-poa:latest --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0
```

### Manual Installation from Source

Manual installation provides more control over the configuration and is suitable for developers and authority node operators.

```bash
# Install Go
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y golang

# Install Geth (Go Ethereum)
wget https://gethstore.blob.core.windows.net/builds/geth-linux-amd64-1.10.26-991356ae.tar.gz
tar -xvzf geth-linux-amd64-1.10.26-991356ae.tar.gz
sudo cp geth-linux-amd64-1.10.26-991356ae/geth /usr/local/bin/

# Clone the HARVEST PoA repository
git clone https://github.com/harvest-network/harvest-poa.git
cd harvest-poa

# Build the HARVEST client
make geth

# Initialize the genesis block
./build/bin/geth --datadir /var/lib/harvest init genesis.json

# Start the HARVEST node
./build/bin/geth --datadir /var/lib/harvest --networkid 4224 --syncmode full --gcmode archive --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0
```

### Setting up a Smart Contract Development Environment

To develop and deploy smart contracts on the HARVEST network, you will need to set up a development environment with Truffle or Hardhat.

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install Truffle Suite
npm install -g truffle

# Create a new Truffle project
mkdir my-harvest-dapp
cd my-harvest-dapp
truffle init
```

Now you can write your Solidity smart contracts in the `contracts/` directory and deploy them to the HARVEST network by configuring `truffle-config.js`.

## Network Configuration

Configuring the network for a HARVEST PoA blockchain is crucial for ensuring secure and reliable communication between nodes. The permissioned nature of PoA requires careful management of network access and peer connections.

### Peer-to-Peer Networking

In a PoA network, nodes are typically known to each other and form a more static and controlled network topology compared to permissionless blockchains. Peer discovery can be managed through a predefined list of bootnodes.

**Bootnodes**: These are trusted nodes that help new nodes join the network. In a PoA setup, you would typically run your own bootnodes and configure your authority nodes to connect to them.

```bash
# Start a bootnode
bootnode -nodekey boot.key -verbosity 9 -addr :30301
```

**Static Peers**: For a highly controlled environment, you can configure your nodes with a list of static peers. This ensures that nodes only connect to other explicitly defined nodes in the network.

In your `config.toml` or as a command-line flag, you can specify the enode URLs of the static peers:

```
--bootnodes enode://<hex-node-id>@<ip-address>:<port>
```

### Firewall Configuration

A properly configured firewall is the first line of defense for your HARVEST nodes. The following `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) rules are recommended for a typical authority node:

```bash
# Deny all incoming traffic by default
sudo ufw default deny incoming

# Allow all outgoing traffic
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH access (replace 22 with your custom SSH port)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Allow P2P communication from other authority nodes
sudo ufw allow from <ip_of_authority_node_1> to any port 30303
sudo ufw allow from <ip_of_authority_node_2> to any port 30303

# Allow RPC access from trusted application servers
sudo ufw allow from <ip_of_app_server> to any port 8545

# Enable the firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

## Authority Node Setup

In the HARVEST Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network, Authority Nodes are the trusted validators responsible for creating new blocks and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. Setting up an authority node is a critical process that requires a high level of security and operational excellence.

### Becoming an Authority

Unlike permissionless networks where anyone can become a validator by staking cryptocurrency, becoming an authority in a PoA network is a permissioned process. The existing authorities in the network must vote to add a new authority. This governance mechanism ensures that only trusted and reputable entities can participate in the consensus process.

The process typically involves:
1.  **Formal Application**: A prospective authority submits a formal application to the HARVEST network's governing body.
2.  **Due Diligence**: The governing body performs due diligence on the applicant to ensure they meet the network's standards for security, reliability, and trustworthiness.
3.  **On-Chain Proposal**: An existing authority creates an on-chain proposal to add the new authority's address to the list of authorized signers.
4.  **Voting**: The existing authorities vote on the proposal. If the proposal reaches the required threshold of votes, the new authority is added to the set.

### Authority Node Configuration

Once an entity is approved to become an authority, they must configure their node for signing blocks. This involves:

1.  **Generating a Signing Key**: Each authority node must have a unique Ethereum account and a corresponding private key. This key will be used to sign new blocks.

    ```bash
    # Create a new account with Geth
    geth account new --datadir /var/lib/harvest
    ```

2.  **Securing the Private Key**: The private key of the authority node is the most critical asset to protect. It should be stored in a secure keystore, and access to it should be strictly limited. For production environments, using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) is highly recommended.

3.  **Configuring the Node for Signing**: When starting the HARVEST node, you must specify the address of the authority account and unlock it so that the node can use it for signing.

    ```bash
    # Start the HARVEST node as an authority
    geth --datadir /var/lib/harvest --networkid 4224 --syncmode full --gcmode archive \
      --mine --miner.etherbase <your-authority-address> --unlock <your-authority-address> --password /path/to/password/file
    ```

### Responsibilities of an Authority Node

Operating an authority node comes with a high level of responsibility. Authorities are expected to:

-   **Maintain High Uptime**: Authority nodes must be online and connected to the network 24/7 to ensure that new blocks are created at regular intervals.
-   **Ensure Security**: Authorities must implement robust security measures to protect their nodes from attacks.
-   **Participate in Governance**: Authorities are responsible for participating in the governance of the network, including voting on proposals to add or remove other authorities.

Failure to meet these responsibilities can result in the removal of the authority from the network.

## Smart Contract and dApp Development

The HARVEST blockchain provides a powerful and secure platform for developing and deploying smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its PoA consensus mechanism ensures high throughput and low transaction fees, making it an ideal environment for a wide range of applications, from supply chain management to digital identity.

### Writing Smart Contracts

Smart contracts on HARVEST are written in Solidity, the most popular programming language for Ethereum-compatible blockchains. If you are new to Solidity, the official Ethereum documentation provides an excellent starting point.

**Key Considerations for HARVEST Smart Contracts**:

-   **Gas Fees**: While transaction fees on HARVEST are significantly lower than on public Ethereum, it is still important to write gas-efficient code to minimize costs.
-   **Immutability**: Once a smart contract is deployed, its code cannot be changed. This is a core feature of blockchain technology that ensures the integrity of your application. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly test your contracts before deploying them.
-   **Security**: Smart contracts can manage valuable assets, so security is of the utmost importance. We recommend following the Smart Contract Security Best Practices to avoid common vulnerabilities.

### Deploying and Interacting with Smart Contracts

You can use popular development tools like Truffle and Hardhat to compile, deploy, and test your smart contracts on the HARVEST network.

**Truffle Configuration (`truffle-config.js`)**:

```javascript
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
const fs = require('fs');
const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync('.secret').toString().trim();

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    harvest: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://rpc.harvest.network`),
      network_id: 4224,
      confirmations: 2,
      timeoutBlocks: 200,
      skipDryRun: true
    },
  },

  // Set default mocha options here, use special reporters etc.
  mocha: {
    // timeout: 100000
  },

  // Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.8.13",
    }
  }
};
```

### Leveraging Immutable Storage for Tracking

The immutable nature of the HARVEST blockchain provides a powerful foundation for building applications that require a high degree of trust and transparency. By storing data on the blockchain, you can create a permanent and tamper-proof record of transactions and events.

**Use Cases for Immutable Tracking**:

-   **Supply Chain Management**: Track goods from origin to consumer, ensuring authenticity and preventing counterfeiting.
-   **Healthcare**: Securely store and share patient records, providing a single source of truth for medical history.
-   **Intellectual Property**: Create a permanent record of ownership for patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
-   **Voting Systems**: Build secure and transparent voting systems that are resistant to fraud and manipulation.

By leveraging the unique features of the HARVEST blockchain, you can build a new generation of applications that are more secure, transparent, and efficient than ever before.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Continuous monitoring and proactive maintenance are essential for ensuring the health, stability, and security of your HARVEST nodes, especially for authority nodes that are critical to the network's operation.

### Monitoring

A comprehensive monitoring setup should track both system-level metrics and blockchain-specific metrics.

**System Metrics**: Monitor the CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage of your node to ensure it has sufficient resources and to detect any performance bottlenecks.

**Blockchain Metrics**: The HARVEST client exposes a rich set of metrics through a Prometheus endpoint. You can use Prometheus to scrape these metrics and Grafana to visualize them in a dashboard.

Key metrics to monitor:

-   `geth_p2p_peers`: Number of connected peers.
-   `geth_txpool_pending`: Number of pending transactions in the transaction pool.
-   `geth_block_processing_time`: Time taken to process a new block.
-   `geth_chain_head`: The current block number of the blockchain.

**Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)**:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'harvest-node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<your-node-ip>:6060']
```

### Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial for keeping your HARVEST node running smoothly and securely.

**Software Updates**: The HARVEST development team will periodically release software updates to introduce new features, improve performance, and patch security vulnerabilities. It is critical to apply these updates in a timely manner.

**Log Management**: Regularly review the logs of your HARVEST node to check for any errors or unusual activity. Use a log rotation tool to prevent log files from consuming too much disk space.

**Key Rotation**: For authority nodes, it is a good security practice to periodically rotate the signing keys. This process should be managed carefully to avoid any disruption to block production.

## Security Hardening

Securing your HARVEST node is of paramount importance, especially if it is an authority node. A compromised authority node can disrupt the entire network.

**Best Practices**:

-   **Minimize Attack Surface**: Only expose the necessary ports to the public internet. Use a firewall to restrict access to the RPC and other management interfaces.
-   **Secure your Keys**: Never store private keys in plaintext. Use a keystore with a strong password, and for production environments, use a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
-   **Regular Audits**: Periodically conduct security audits of your nodes and the underlying infrastructure to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

## Backup and Recovery

A robust backup and recovery plan is essential for minimizing downtime in the event of a hardware failure or other disaster.

**What to Back Up**:

-   **Keystore**: The most critical data to back up is the keystore containing the private keys of your node.
-   **Blockchain Data**: While you can always resync the blockchain data from the network, backing it up can significantly reduce the recovery time.

**Backup Strategy**:

-   **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups of your keystore and blockchain data.
-   **Off-site Storage**: Store your backups in a secure, off-site location to protect against physical disasters.

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

-   **Node not syncing**: Check your network connectivity and firewall settings. Ensure you are connected to the correct bootnodes.
-   **Transactions not being mined**: Check the transaction pool to see if your transaction is pending. Ensure you have a high enough gas price.

## Performance Optimization

-   **Hardware**: Use high-performance hardware, especially for authority nodes.
-   **Network**: Ensure you have a low-latency, high-bandwidth network connection.
-   **Configuration**: Tune the configuration of your HARVEST node to optimize for your specific workload.
